<p> The problem that we might addressing is how the climate change impact the ecosystem in the ocean. Rising ocean temperature might cause the fish to move to the cooler waters. Did you know that warming water actually holds less oxygen? That is why fishes wants to move to the place where they have more oxygen. This can also affect the fisherman because if the fishes move from where the fisherman used to catch them then they canâ€™t sell it to businesses and make money. </p>

<p>
  Another problem is that climate change is bad for our health. Exposure to extreme heat can lead to heat stroke and dehydration, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular disease. Excessive heat is more likely to affect populations in northern latitudes where people are less prepared to cope with excessive temperatures. Certain types of populations are more vulnerable than others: for example, outdoor workers, student athletes, and homeless people tend to be more exposed to extreme heat because they spend more time outdoors. Low-income households and older adults may lack access to air conditioning which also increases exposure to extreme heat. Additionally, young children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with certain medical conditions are less able to regulate their body temperature and can therefore be more vulnerable to extreme heat
