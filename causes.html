  <h1> What causes climate change?</h1>

<h2>1. heat trapping greenhouse gases </h2>
  <main>
  <p>When human activities create greenhouse gases, Earth warms. This matters because oceans, land, air, plants, animals and energy from the Sun all have an effect on one another. The combined effects of all these things give us our global climate. In other words, Earthâ€™s climate functions like one big, connected system.</p>
  </main>
<h2>2. burning fossil fuels </h2>
  <main>
  <p>
    Fossil fuels produce large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to climate change. In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly for the power and transportation sectors, accounts for about three-quarters of our carbon emissions.
  </p>
  </main>
<h2>3. emissions from volcanoes</h2>
  <main>
  <p>
    By far the most abundant volcanic gas is water vapor, which is harmless. However, significant amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen halides can also be emitted from volcanoes. Depending on their concentrations, these gases are all potentially hazardous to people, animals, agriculture, and property.
  </p>
  </main>
<h2>4. cutting down forests</h2>
  <main>
  <p>
    Deforestation and forest degradation are responsible for around 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. These greenhouse gas emissions contribute to rising temperatures, changes in patterns of weather and water, and an increased frequency of extreme weather events.
  </p>
  </main>
<h2>5. use too much power</h2>
  <main>
  <p>
    Emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, especially when a fuel is burned. Use of water resources to produce steam, provide cooling, and serve other functions.
  </p>
  </main>
<h2>6. using transportations</h2>
  <main>
  <p>The environmental effects of transport are significant because transport is a major user of energy, and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide.</p>
